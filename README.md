Bowling game score code 


The way the code works is it ask the user to input a numeric value for the amuont of pins knocked down in throw one.
It looks at the number inputed by the user and checks to see one if its greater than 10 or less than 0.
Then it checks to see if the imput is eqaul to 10 and if so therefore its a strike and it moves on to the next franme.
But if its less than 10 for example if throw 1= 6, then it will go to throw 2 
If throw 2 and throw 1 sum up to 10 it will be a spare for that frame, then on to the next.

Instead of inputing x put the number 10 and instead of / put in the remainding pins in throw 2

On that note the one problem i have found is that lets say the user accidentally inputs a anything other than the input the program would crash.

It passes all the test 
X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-XX (10+10+10) + (10+10+10) + (10+10+10) + (10+10+10) + (10+10+10) + (10+10+10) + (10+10+10) + (10+10+10) + (10+10+10) + (10+10+10)= 300
45-54-36-27-09-63-81-18-90-72 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9= 90 
5/-5/-5/-5/-5/-5/-5/-5/-5/-5/-5 (10+5) + (10+5) + (10+5) + (10+5) + (10+5) + (10+5) + (10+5) + (10+5) + (10+5) + (10+5)= 150 
45-54-36-27-09-63-81-18-90-7/-5 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + (10 + 5)= 96
